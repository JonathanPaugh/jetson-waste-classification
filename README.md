# Jetson Waste Classification
> Non-Perishable Waste Classification

This repo contains Group 5's source code for the COMP 4989 (BCIT Fall 2022) self-directed project.

## Development
1. Download a dataset ([`asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification) was used for development)
2. Move the dataset into the project root. Each class should have its own folder, like so:
```sh
$ tree dataset -L 1
dataset
├── cardboard
├── glass
├── metal
├── paper
├── plastic
└── trash
```
3. Run `py main.py`
